We used recursion to find Fibonacci number, however this could not be an <br>
efficient way to do it if for a higher number as we can see the same recursive <br>
steps being carried out which needs to be optimised. This is where dynamic 
<br>programming comes into picture which would help us optimise these <br>
repetitive recursive calls and improve time as well as memory management of the code.
